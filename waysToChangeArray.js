// An array's length, like the data types it can contain, is not fixed. Arrays can be defined with a length of any number of elements, and elements can be added or removed over time; in other words, arrays are mutable.

//To add items from an array...
//to the beginning use unshift()
//to the end use push()

// To remove items from array...
//at end of the array use pop()
//at beginning of the array shift()

/****Splice() */
//To edit items in the middle of the array
//splice() can take up to 3 parameters
//splice returns a new array and MUTATES the original array
//splice(what INDEX to start removing, how many elements to remove)

//you can use the third parameter, comprised of one or more element(s), to add to the array. This can be incredibly useful for quickly switching out an element, or a set of elements, for another.

const numbers = [10, 11, 12, 12, 15];
const startIndex = 3;
const amountToDelete = 1;

numbers.splice(startIndex, amountToDelete, 13, 14);
console.log(numbers);

/*****Slice*****/
//slice copies or extracts a given numbers of elments to a new array, does not mutate the original array.

// slice() takes only 2 parameters â€” the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop extraction (extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index). Consider this:

let weatherConditions = ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'];

let todaysWeather = weatherConditions.slice(1, 3);


// todaysWeather would have the value ['snow', 'sleet'], while weatherConditions would still have ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'].
